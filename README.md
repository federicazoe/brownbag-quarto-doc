# Workshop goals

Learn/review (not exactly in this order):
- markdown formatting (bold, italic, code, sections)
- html vs. pdf
- uses (homework, data analysis reports, research reports, papers)
- in-line code
- math formulas (also add more latex packages)
- code chunks common options (include, echo, fig. and table properties, cache)
- add figures
- add tables
- cross-referencing in Quarto
- citations 
- child documents (good for organization of long docs and for co-authoring)


Integrations with:
- Zotero
- Overleaf


# Idea

1. I will create exercise documents, each for learning or practicing subgroups of the learning goals. The exercise documents will have parts for people to fill (e.g. missing yaml, figure/table, no citations)
